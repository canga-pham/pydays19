## What's this?

This repo contains Python code for scraping, cleaning and analysing political debates from the Hansard archive (https://hansard.parliament.uk/).

## Requirements

You'll need Python 3 on your machine, together with your package manager of choice. If you're running Python > 3.4, you should already have the package manager pip installed.

## Getting set up

1. *Clone this repository*

If you have git installed on your machine, you can do this by navigating to the place you'd like to download this code to and running ```git clone XXX``` in your terminal.

If you don't have git, you can hit 'download zip' instead and extract the files to a convenient location.

2. *Set up a virtual environment*

In the same directory you've downloaded this code to, run ```python3 -m venv 3.7``` to create a virtual environment. Then run ```source 3.7/bin/activate``` to start it up.

3. *Install the requirements*

Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install all the libraries we'll be using in this workshop.
